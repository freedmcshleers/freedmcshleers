How Do I Get a Payday Loan?

Payday loan providers are typically small credit merchants with physical stores that allow on-site credit applications and approval. Some payday loan services also may be available through online lenders.

To complete a payday loan application, you must normally provide pay stubs from your employer that show your current level of income. Payday lenders often base their loan principal on a percentage of the borrower’s predicted short-term income. Many also use a borrower’s wages as collateral. Lenders generally do not conduct a full credit check or consider your ability to repay the loan.
