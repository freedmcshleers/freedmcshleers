 Using Payday Loans

Payday loans charge borrowers high levels of interest and do not require any collateral, making them a type of unsecured personal loan. These loans may be considered predatory lending, as they have extremely high interest, don’t consider a borrower’s ability to repay, and have hidden provisions that charge borrowers added fees.1 As a result, they can create a debt trap for consumers. If you’re considering a payday loan, then you may want to look first at safer personal loan alternatives.
How Do Payday Loans Work?

Payday loan providers will normally require you to show proof of your income—usually your pay stubs from your employer. They will then lend you a portion of the money that you will be paid. You will have to pay the loan back within a short time, generally 30 days or less.
